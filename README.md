# Etch-A-Sketch
## Description
This program allows the user to draw within a square grid as if it were an etch-a-sketch similar to the children's toy. 
This was a project as part of The Odin Project's curriculum and involved HTML, CSS, and Javascript technologies.
At this time the project is "finished" for my knowledge is limited, however, there are some features I wish to add at a later date when my skills catch up to my ideas.
